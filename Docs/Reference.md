# LocalizeAgent reference

How the `localize` agent is found, what a call takes and answers, which strings it reads, how the files are made, and
how to test it. What it is for is in the [README](../README.md); the agent standard it follows is Granite's
[granite-agent/1](https://github.com/riteshpakala/Granite/blob/main/Schema/GraniteAgent.md).

## How an app finds it

LocalizeAgent is a `GraniteAgentPackage`, and it carries a record in its binary:

```swift
@used @section("__DATA_CONST,__granite")
let localizeRecord: GraniteRoster.Record = { GraniteRoster.record(LocalizeAgent.self) }
```

In [Craft](https://github.com/riteshpakala/Craft), install it from the Agent Store or with
`craft agents add https://github.com/rao-craft/LocalizeAgent.git`, then say `$localize` in a request:

```
$localize the recipe app into French, German, Japanese and Arabic
```

The model writes the call (`{"languages": ["fr", "de", "ja", "ar"]}`); the call shows on Craft's agent map as
`localize-1`, and the tables and project file it names are built with the turn.

## What a call takes and answers

| Field | | |
|---|---|---|
| `languages` | optional | codes such as `fr`, `de`, `ja`, `zh-Hans`, `pt-BR` (names like `French` are read too), or `loom` for Loom's 28; every language the app has when left out |
| `source` | optional | the language the Swift's strings are written in; `en` when left out |
| `format` | optional | `strings` (one `Localizable.strings` a language) or `catalog` (one `Localizable.xcstrings`); what the project uses when left out |
| `into` | optional | the folder holding the `.lproj` folders or the catalog; where the project keeps them, else `Shared/i18n` |
| `scan` | optional | folders or Swift files to read; the whole project when left out |
| `refresh` | optional | `true` translates every string of the languages named again; existing translations are kept when left out |
| `helper` | optional | `true` writes `String+Localized.swift` with `localized()` beside the strings' folder |
| `rounds` | optional | how many times a batch is asked for before what fails stays in the source language; 3, at most 6 |
| `directory` | the host's | the folder the host works in; a host fills it and does not show it to a model |

The answer is a `LocalizeResult`: every file written (`path`, `paths`, absolute; a file that came out the same is not
written), the app's languages, how many strings were found, added and translated, the languages that still wait, and a
sentence for anything left out.

```json
{"languages": ["fr", "de", "ja", "ar"]}
{"languages": ["loom"]}
{}
{"languages": ["es", "pt-BR"], "format": "catalog"}
{"languages": ["fr"], "refresh": true}
{"languages": ["it"], "helper": true}
{"languages": ["ko"], "scan": ["Components", "Shared/Views"]}
```

## The strings

A literal is a key where SwiftUI or Foundation looks it up at run time: the first argument of `Text`, `Label`, `Button`,
`Toggle`, `Section`, `TextField`, `Picker`, `Menu`, `Link`, `ContentUnavailableView` and the other views that take a
`LocalizedStringKey`; `.navigationTitle`, `.help`, `.alert`, `.confirmationDialog`, `.accessibilityLabel`;
`String(localized:)`, `LocalizedStringResource`, `LocalizedStringKey`, `NSLocalizedString`, `"KEY".localized()`; a ternary
of literals in those places; and a literal given to a property or parameter the app declares as a `LocalizedStringKey`, or
returned by a computed one. An interpolation becomes the specifier the runtime asks for: an `Int` is `%lld`, an `Int32`
`%d`, a `Double` `%lf`, a `specifier:` its own, anything else `%@`; a `%` beside one is doubled. A key with several
specifiers reads numbered in the source language (`Cooked by %1$@ in %2$lld minutes`), so a language can reorder them.
The call's `comment:` is kept above its entry.

Not a key: `Text(verbatim:)`, a literal built into a `String`, a string with no letters (`"•"`, `"\(name)"`), another
table's or a package's string, and a preview's sample text. `.build`, `DerivedData`, packages and tests are not read
unless `scan` names them.

## How the files are made

| Step | What |
|---|---|
| Read | the call checked; every problem refused at once, and nothing written |
| Harvest | every Swift file's declarations read (a name's type, a parameter that takes a key), then every file's keys |
| Table | the app's strings read from its `.lproj` files or catalog; a key the Swift no longer shows is kept (a key built at run time is not seen) |
| Source | a key in capitals (`RECIPES_EMPTY_TITLE`) gets its source text from the model; every other key is its own |
| Translate | what a language lacks, what stands in for a translation, and what was made from a changed source text, asked for in batches of at most 40 by id, with what each string is (a button, a title, its comment) |
| Check | every answer: every specifier kept at its position and of its type, every line break, not left in the source language, not a paragraph; a bad one is asked for again with the reason, and what fails every round stays in the source language and is named |
| Write | one table a language, sorted, its comments kept; a language's entry says the source text it was made from when that is not the key, and marks a stand-in; a language nothing changed in is left as it is; every table is read back by the system's property list reader before it lands |
| Project | the languages in `knownRegions`, and the strings' folder inside a synchronized folder of every app target (a classic project gets each language's file in its `Localizable.strings` group); idempotent text edits read back before they land |

Without a model the source language is still written, and the answer names the languages that wait.

## Testing

```
swift test                       # the record, the schema, the harvest (matched against the compiler's own), the tables, the checks, whole calls
LOCALIZE_BUILD=1 swift test      # a recipe app localized into four languages, built for macOS and the iOS Simulator, and run
```
